*This project was completed as a part of Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course. For this project I created a table for a bookstore that contained data on the book 
titles, price, book format and page numbers. I then pulled applicable data from it to answer my questions raised.**

CREATE TABLE bookstore (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, format TEXT, pages INTEGER);

INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (1,"Set for Life", 15, "ebook", 200);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (2, "The Eye of the World", 15, "ebook", 210);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (3, "Lies My Teacher Told Me", 15, "ebook", 200);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (4, "Nonviolent Communication", 10, "ebook", 300);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (5, "The Millionaire Next Door", 11, "ebook", 180);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (6, "Tax-Free Wealth", 7, "print", 238);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (7, "House of Daemon", 8, "ebook", 250);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (8, "Girls Weekend", 15, "ebook", 105);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (9, "HeartStopper", 10, "ebook", 190);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (10, "Orc-ward Encounters", 7, "ebook", 220);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (11, "Casual Cryptids: East Coast", 12, "ebook", 300);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (12, "Mistlefoe", 5, "ebook", 189);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (13, "Ice Planet Barbarians", 9, "ebook", 330);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (14, "Taken By The Alien Next Door", 10, "ebook", 201);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (15, "Squad", 15, "print", 150);
